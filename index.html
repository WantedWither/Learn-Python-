<body><P> <h1> In this page you will learn the basics of python!  </p>
<p> The first command you will learn is the print command, the /print command lets you print something of the screen (write something on the screen)</p>
<p>                                                                </p>
<p> Now what more can the print command do other than writing something on the screen? Well print can also add numbers! for example if you did /print
("5+5") isntead of printing 5+5 it will print the answer of 5+5 which is 10. you can do this with + - / *.
</p>
<p> But what if your Doing /print ("5/2") it will give 
the answer without the remainder and if  you want the remainder than just do /print ("5%2").</P>print ("5%2").</P>
<P> _______________________________</P>
<P> Another command in python is variables
variables can store stuff for example if you did hi = 1 than did /print ("hi") it would print 1 not hi because hi was set to be 1. you can also do /print ("hi*3") and it would give 111.</P>
<p> now how could you use variables? well you can use them in a calculator! for more info on how to build a calculator copy and paste this link in your browser:</p>
